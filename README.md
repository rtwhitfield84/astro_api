This is the api for [Astro](https://github.com/rtwhitfield84/astro_mobile) (AUDIO SIGNATURE TABLATURE RETRIEVAL OPERATION). See the mobile app [README](https://github.com/rtwhitfield84/astro_mobile/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to install. Once you have installed Astro mobile and registered, you can utilize Astro to recognize a song and save the guitar tablature to your profile accessible via the [desktop client](https://github.com/rtwhitfield84/astro_website).
